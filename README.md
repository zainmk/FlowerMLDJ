# FlowerMLDJ

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to utilize tensorflow CNN and classify images of flowers. The tf tutorial was heavily used [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn). We then host the application through Django to serve
the model and allow some basic UI through a html template.

The CNN model starts off with basic training and is not a great classifier. We use the notebook.ipynb to experiment with different ML methods to strengthen the model and understand the effect these ML techniques have
on the results they generate.
